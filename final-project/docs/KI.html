The first step is to understand why one wishes to go on this adventure. The "why" acts as guidance, whether it be a pastime or a goal to design a pollinator-friendly area. Additionally, Kimberly highlights the importance of community involvement, emphasizing how involving more people fosters shared responsibility and the chance to instruct and motivate others.

Kimberly takes pride in showcasing the miraculous occurrences that unfold within her sanctuary, leaving visitors in awe of the beauty and interconnectedness of the natural world.
                
                Future Plans and Goals:

Sharing personal experiences with nature, according to Kimberly, can help people appreciate and comprehend how intertwined all living things are.
