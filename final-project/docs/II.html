                Irene Hong Lam
              
                Having grown up in Shanghai during the 1970’s and 1980’s we had a garden in our yard, and my
                grandfather was my first culinary guide. Living in Shanghai, New York City, Hong Kong and now
                Chicago the kitchen has always been my sanctuary and place of peace. I simply love to cook and
                have learned to use various herbs and spices over the years to give common meals a special
                touch to increase flavors and add healthy ingredients. This is my passion as well as raising
                awareness of what we are putting into our bodies in an age of industrial food sales. In my home
                I like to know as much as possible about what we are eating and enjoying the social aspects of
                the family meal.
