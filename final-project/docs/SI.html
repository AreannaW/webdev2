            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>I first spoke with my grandmother, Sarah Barnes, about her love of gardening and the great influence that plants have had on her life. She recalled a Dieffenbachia that she had cared for 20 years after receiving it as a gift when asked about her first plant. Her desire to increase the air quality in her house sparked an interest in plants, which led them to begin with a Philodendron and a Wandering Jew. She began to gather plants throughout time, both as presents and during family funerals.</p>
            <p>When asked which plant she preferred, my grandma said she loved all plants and the beauty they added to rooms. Her biggest struggle with growing plants is getting ready for the winter and finding a location with enough sunlight. She does, however, think that the benefits plants offer, like enhancing mood and lowering stress, make the effort worthwhile. Her struggle to keep a plant alive until she realized it needed more water than she was providing is one of her most strong memories. She highlighted the importance of teaching young people about gardening and cited the financial, environmental, and health advantages of producing one's own food and plants.
